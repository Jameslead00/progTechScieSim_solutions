//Random library
/* Implement a linear congruential random number generator,
Xn+1 = (aXn+ c) mod m,
where m is the largest number that your generator will output. Xn, a and c are
integers and m > 0, 0 < a < m and 0 â‰¤c < m are constants. X0 is the initial seed.
You may use the following set of constants:
m = 232
a = 1664525
c = 1013904223
Make sure that the interface of the generator class is consistent with the one used
in the benchmark program.
Use CMake to build and install the random number generator as a library */
